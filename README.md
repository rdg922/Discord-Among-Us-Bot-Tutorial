## About

This repo contains documented code for all the discord bots we've been doing during the CS Clubs, so if you've missed anything from the club check here for any code.

### Downloads:

[Node:](https://nodejs.org/en/) That's it!

If you want to follow along I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com), but that isn't necessary for the tutorials, though it does help.

### References:

We'll be using the official [Discord.js documentation](https://discord.js.org/#/) for looking up things, but feel free to google this is a popular library.
For getting our credentials we'll be using [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
For adding our bot to our server we'll be using [DIscord Permissions Calculator](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html)

## Which Day Covers What:

**Getting Started With an Among Us Bot:**

* Day 1: Getting started and toggle muting a single @ed person through one command
* Day 2?: Muting all people in a single VC and sending custom Discord Messages
* Day 3?: Keeping track of alive & dead players and handling multiple commands

## Instructions:
The folders are organized by day, so refer back to the above for more information on which days cover what. You only need the items in the folder, and if there is not a package.json, copy that from the root directory into wherever you run this code, and edit your config.json appropriately. Then, navigate to the directory in your terminal and run the following commands:
```
npm i
node index.js
```
All the files are named index.js currently, but if that everchanges, replace that with the name of the file (that is not config.json or package.json)

## Possible Future Projects:**
* Hangman
If you have an idea for a Discord Bot that you want me to consider, make sure to open an issue and I may make it!
